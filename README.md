# Momentum

**Momentum** is similar to the Chrome Web Store [application](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/momentum/laookkfknpbbblfpciffpaejjkokdgca?hl=ru). It shows the time and user name. The background image and greeting changes depending on the time of day. The application has a clock, an image slider, weather widget, an audio player, a quote of the day block and settings. Local storage is used to store the username and location.
